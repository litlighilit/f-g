<br>

> **<ins>This is a branch in aardio-lang which is specifically for Windows,thus [the built exe file](https://github.com/litlighilit/f-g/blob/aardio_exe/aardio_python.exe) is uploaded together</ins>**

## factor :pushpin:
* site-package-supported by matplotlib  
* act in ~~tkinter~~ aardio
* ~enable to [change color,linestyle and marker](#change-colorlinestyle-and-marker)(specifically marker) freely~ yet not supported in this version(aardio_exe branch)
* [c.txt](/src/c.txt) in src stores [specal markers](#m) used for marker_cg(change marker function)

## operation :black_nib:
### input
> you can input the followings in mathematical convention(in available table)

available|meaning|python expressing
-|-|-
&nbsp;(blank space)|times|*
^|power|**
log_{a}(x)|the log of x to base a(log<sub>a</sub>x))|

examples: y=x log_{2}(x^2)  :arrow_right:  y=x log<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup><!--$\rightarrow y=x log_2 x^2$-->  
&emsp;What's more,you con input something like`y=x,-10<x<10,r--,n=10`to initialize more accurately
### ~~change color,linestyle and marker~~ yet not supported
click a object,then press right mouse button  
where there will post a menu for you to change the object's color,linestyle and marker  
*<h4 id="m"> specal markers  </h4>*
in c.txt,there are some Greek alphabets to be used as special markers  
### a Hotkey
~~`ctrl`+`button-1(left mouse button)` to open a exec-interface~~ is not supported
## model_ones
if you are more interested in modular programming,please move to [the model_ones](https://github.com/litlighilit/f-g/tree/model_ones)
> note:
> Due to the lack of time,[it](#model_ones)'s just partly modularized(but can run smoothly)
## something to say :envelope:
f-g was created during my Senior-2's holiday(2021)  

originally inspired by [Geogebra](https://geogebra.org/)
